- Hello! I'm Shadab Hasan Hakimi, a proactive and ambitious BTech third-year student at Gurukul Institute of Engineering and Technology. Passionate about technology and its transformative potential, with a strong 
  foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. I'm currently diving deep into the world of web development, focusing on mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

- Driven by a curiosity for cutting-edge innovations, I'm also exploring the fascinating realms of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I believe that by continually expanding my skills and 
  knowledge in these areas, I can contribute to creating impactful solutions that address real-world challenges.

- Outside of my academic pursuits, I actively seek opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging technology to drive 
  positive change and am always eager to explore new ideas and possibilities.
